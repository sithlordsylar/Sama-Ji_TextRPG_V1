## 🌀 Game Summary

In this metaphysical journey, you are chosen by fate to reawaken the sealed cosmic power of **Sama-Ji** — a divine being beyond time, worshipped by frog-like cherubims known as **Kunjumons** and above all the source of all existence and non-existence.

To ascend and merge with Sama-Ji, you must:
- Visit the 8 Temples of the **Kunjus**, each representing a divine aspect of Sama-Ji which were bestowed the gift of life itself and turned into a fragment of Sama-Ji's power.
- Pass trials in surreal **Realms** tied to each Kunju’s energy.
- Solve riddles, defeat trivia, dance to ancient Aztec ritual dubstep, and answer cursed callings.

Every fragment collected brings you closer to unlocking your place at the **Dimension 69** — the apex of existence.

P.s.
The game and the lore is pretty NSFW and heavily created with the non-sensical and intensely absurd imagination of Melvin Satoru and Rishi D. Owh Yeah along side with the LLM AI Overlords.
The whole concept of this game and the lore in itself is to see how much further one can push the pre-existing LLM models and train them with absurd knowledge and have it serve as one of the lore masters. In another word, I did this cause I was bored asf. Lol

Owh Yeah! Heil Sama Ji!
Heil the 4th Reich!
Heil the 69th Dimension Supreme Kunjus!
